      Happy Birthday to my favorite human, Athira!
      From meeting in the halls of 11th grade to being best friends forever, I’m so lucky to have had you by my side through it all. You’ve been my constant support and my biggest laugh for years now, and I can’t imagine life without our endless chats and inside jokes. I hope your day is as bright and beautiful as you are—here’s to a lifetime more of memories together! 
      I love you the most 💗

      My life has been so much better with you in it. From the classroom giggles to the late-night heart-to-hearts, every moment we spend together becomes a favorite memory of mine. We’ve grown up so much, yet we’re still those same two girls who can laugh until it hurts over absolutely nothing. Thank you, Athira, for being my constant, my sister, and my best friend forever.
      I cherish every "us" moment we've ever shared!
      <br><br>
      <b>LOTS OF LOVE 💗</b>
